any nation or government, state or other political subdivision thereof, any entity exercising legislative, judicial or

to provide a blockchain address and link directly to a third-party NFT With Music-Supported Blockchain 
node or link indirectly through any NFT With Music-Supported Blockchain cryptocurrency wallet application

including collectibles, artwork, videos, game items, etc. (together with the NFT, a “Collectible”) for sale,
trade, or other distribution via the Service. NFTs are intended to be “non-fungible” with a Uniform
Resource Identifier (“URI”) identifying an appropriately configured JavaScript Object Notation file (the 
“Collectible ID”). If you use the Service to mint Collectibles, you must separately review and agree to
the Creator Terms and Conditions and create a “Creator Account.”<br/><br/>
2.5 Your General Covenants, Representations and Warranties. By using the Service, you covenant, represent,
and warrant as follows: <br/><br/>

to you, or any contract or agreement to which you are a party or by which you are bound.
<br/><br/>(b) No Claim, Loan, Ownership Interest, or Investment Purpose. Your purchase, sale, holding, receipt and use of

business or venture;
<br/><br/>&emsp;(ii) provide you with any ownership interest, equity, security, or right to or interest in the assets, rights, properties, 
revenues or profits of, or voting rights whatsoever in, NFT With Music or any other business or venture; and
<br/><br/>&emsp;(iii) create or imply or entitle you to the benefits of any fiduciary or other agency relationship between NFT With 
Music or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, on the on hand, and you, on the other hand.

or its securities, but solely wish to use the Service for its intended purposes.<br/><br/>

related technologies and assets, including NFT With Music-Supported Blockchains, NFTs, Collectibles and “smart 
contracts” (bytecode deployed to a blockchain). You have conducted your own thorough independent investigation 
and analysis of the Service and the other matters contemplated by these Terms, and have not relied up-on any 
information, statement, omission, representation, or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on 
behalf of NFT With Music in connection therewith, except as expressly set forth by NFT With Music in these Terms.
<br/><br/>(d) Taxes. You are solely responsible for assessing all Taxes owed, if any, for your use of the Service, including,

agencies, and other similar municipal, state, federal, national or other withholding and personal or corporate
income taxes.

that enable you to export information, including User Content (defined below), to third-party
services, including through features that allow you to link your Account with an account on the third-party

any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of such content. During monitoring, information may be examined,
recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
<br/><br/>8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION
<br/><br/>8.1 Respect of Third Party Rights. NFT With Music respects the intellectual property rights of others, 
takes the protection of intellectual property rights very seriously, and asks users of the Service to do the 
same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.
<br/><br/>8.2 DMCA Notification. We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable 
to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. § 512, as amended). If you have an intellectual property rights-related
complaint about any material on the Service, you may contact our Designated Agent at the following 
address:
<br/>MUZI NFT LLC.
<br/>Address: 11954 Narcoossee Rd, Suite 252, Orlando FL 32832
<br/>Email: nftdemusica@gmail.com
<br/><br/>8.3 Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any content made available on or 
through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right 
you own or control, then please promptly send a written “Notification of Claimed Infringement” to the 
Designated Agent identified above containing the following information:
<br/><br/>(a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or 
other right being infringed;
<br/><br/>(b) a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;
<br/><br/>(c) a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Service, including a 
URL representing a link to the material on the NFT With Music website;
<br/><br/>(d) your address, telephone number, and email address;
<br/><br/>(e) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Service of which you 
are complaining is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property right owner, its agent, or the 
law; and
<br/><br/>(f) a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, 
you are the copyright or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual 
property owner’s behalf.
<br/><br/>Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by NFT With Music with the user alleged 
to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available 
databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to NFT With Music 
making such disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to 
confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.
<br/><br/>8.4 Repeat Infringers. NFT With Music’s policy is to:
<br/><br/>(a) remove or disable access to material that NFT With Music believes in good faith, upon notice from an
intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third 
party by being made available through the Service; and
<br/><br/>(b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Service by any user who 
repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. NFT With Music 
will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by NFT With Music to be repeat infringers. NFT With Music 
reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion.
<br/><br/>8.5 Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from NFT With Music that material made available
by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then 
you will have the right to provide NFT With Music with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be
effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to NFT With Music’s Designated Agent through
one of the methods identified in Section 8.2, and include substantially the following information:
(a) your physical or electronic signature;
(b) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location 
at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
(c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or
disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
(d) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal 
District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United 
States, then for any judicial district in which NFT With Music may be found, and that you will accept service of 
process from the person who provided notification under Section 8.2 above or an agent of that person.
A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm
the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.
8.6 Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter Notification to NFT With
Music in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then NFT With Music will promptly provide 
the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification
and inform that person that NFT With Music will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling 
access to it in 10 business days, and NFT With Music will replace the removed User Content and cease 
disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter 
Notification, unless NFT With Music’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the
Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain
the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on NFT With Music’s system or network.
8.7 False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides at 
17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that:
“[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 
512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake 
or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged 
infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured 
by such misrepresentation, as the result of [NFT With Music] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or 
disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing 
to disable access to it.” NFT With Music reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits

10. MODIFICATION OF TERMS.
We may, from time to time, change these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for 
changes. Revisions will be effective immediately except that, for existing users, material revisions 
will be effective 30 days after posting or notice to you of the revisions unless otherwise stated. 
We may require that you accept the modified Terms in order to continue to use the Service. If you 
do not agree to the modified Terms, then you should remove your User Content and discontinue 
your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted in this Section 10, these Terms may be 
amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties to
these Terms. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms and understand modifications to 
these Terms as they may be updated from time to time.
11. TERM, TERMINATION, AND MODIFICATION OF THE SERVICE
11.1 Term. These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install, 
access, or use the Service, and ending when terminated as described in Section 11.2.
11.2 Termination. If you violate any provision of these Terms, your authorization to access the Service and
these Terms automatically terminates. In addition, NFT With Music may, at its sole discretion, terminate 
these Terms or your Account, or suspend or terminate your access to the Service, at any time for any 
reason or no reason, with or without notice. You may terminate your Account and these Terms at any time
by visiting https://nftdemusica.com.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new or by contacting customer 
service at nftdemusica@gmail.com.
11.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of these Terms:
(a) your license rights will terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the Service;
(b) you will no longer be authorized to access your Account or the Service;
(c) you must pay NFT With Music any unpaid amount that was due prior to termination; and
(d) all payment obligations accrued prior to termination and Sections 5.1, 5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 9, 11.3, 12, 13, 13.3, 14.10, 
and 15 will survive.
11.4 Modification of the Service. NFT With Music reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service at
any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Service), temporarily or permanently,
without notice to you. NFT With Music will have no liability for any change to the Service or any suspension
or termination of your access to or use of the Service.
12. INDEMNITY.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Service and for any
Minor’s use of the Service occurring through your Account, and you will defend and indemnify 
NFT With Music, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, directors, managers, members, 
officers, employees, consultants, and agents (together, the “NFT With Music Entities”) from and 
against every claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, 
including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or connected with:
(1) your or your Minor’s unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Service;
(2) your or your Minor’s violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement
referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation;
(3) your or your Minor’s violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity,
confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or
(4) any dispute or issue between you or your Minor and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own 
expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification 
by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, 
you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.
13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; NO WARRANTY BY 
 NFT WITH MUSIC
13.1 No Responsibility for NFTs or Collectibles; No Guarantee of Uniqueness or IP. NFT With Music has 
no responsibility for Collectibles that Users trade via the Service. NFT With Music does not investigate 
and cannot guarantee or warrant the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, marketability, legality, or value 
of any Collectibles that Users trade on the Service.
The Collectible ID of an NFT and the content embodied therein specifies the properties of the NFT and 
the content embodied therein, including the name and description of the NFT and the content embodied 
therein (the “Collectible Descriptors”), a URI identifying any image file associated with the Collectible 
(the “Collectible Image”) and potentially other “metadata” associated with the Collectible (the Collectible 
Descriptors, Collectible Image and such other metadata, collectively, the “Collectible Metadata”). The 
Collectible Metadata for Collectibles that are created through the NFT With Music Applications may be 
stored on InterPlanetary File System (“IPFS”) through a third-party distributed cloud service (e.g., Pinata) 
or a third-party storage chain (e.g., Filecoin).
The Collectible Metadata for Collectibles that are created outside the NFT With Music Applications may be
stored in other ways, depending on how such Collectibles were created. There can be no guarantee or
assurance of the uniqueness, originality or quality of any Collectible or Collectible Metadata. In the absence
of an express legal agreement between the creator of any Collectibles and purchasers of Collectibles, 
there cannot be any guarantee or assurance that the purchase or holding of Collectibles confers any license
to or ownership of the Collectible Metadata or other intellectual property associated with Collectibles
or any other right or entitlement, notwithstanding that you may rightfully own or possess the Collectible.
NFT With Music may from time to time remove certain Collectibles from the Service or restrict the creation
of Collectibles on the Service in NFT With Music’s sole and absolute discretion, including in connection 
with any belief by NFT With Music that such Collectibles violate these Terms. NFT With Music does not 
commit and will not be liable for any failure to support, display or offer or continue to support, display,
or offer any Collectibles for trading through the Service.
13.2 No Professional Advice or Liability. All information provided by or on behalf of NFT With Music is for 
informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional, accounting, or legal advice. 
You should not take or refrain from taking any action in reliance on any information contained in these 
Terms or provided by or on behalf of NFT With Music. Before you make any financial, legal, or other 
decisions involving the Service, you should seek independent professional advice from persons licensed 
and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate. You must always use caution when 
giving out any personally information to other Users or third-party linked websites through the Service. 
NFT With Music does not control or endorse User Content, any third-party content, messages, or
information found in the Service and NFT With Music will not be liable for any use or misuse of User Content
by any User. NFT With Music specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Service and any
actions resulting from your use of the Service.
13.3 Disclaimers Related to Blockchain Technology. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, 
and notwithstanding anything otherwise expressly provided herein, NFT With Music disclaims any and 
all liability related to the following:
(a) Use of Blockchain Technology. NFT With Music utilizes experimental cryptographic and blockchain technologies,
including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and
distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems in providing the Service. You acknowledge and agree
that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty 
regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto. To the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, NFT With Music disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing.
(b) Certain Risks of Blockchain Technology. The technology utilized in delivering the Service depends on public 
peer-to-peer networks such as the NFT With Music-Supported Blockchains that are not under the control or influence
of NFT With Music and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. NFT With Music may have limited or no ability 
to change these technologies, other than ceasing to support certain “smart contracts” and adding support for new 
“smart contracts”. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the NFT With 
Music-Supported Blockchain address used to participate in the Service. NFT With Music will not be able to restore 
or issue any refunds due to lost private keys. If you are not able to use the Service due to loss or theft of a private 
key or otherwise, NFT With Music does not guarantee and is not responsible for your ability to exercise their rights 
with respect to such Collectible or any other applicable digital assets.
(c) Certain Risks of Smart Contract Technology. NFTs and the content embodied therein and other digital assets 
relevant to the Service depend on smart contracts deployed to NFT With Music-Supported Blockchains, and some 
may be coded or deployed by persons other than NFT With Music. Once deployed to NFT With Music- Supported 
Blockchain(s), the code of smart contracts cannot be modified. In the event that applicable smart contracts are 
adversely affected by malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent coding or design 
choices, or changes to the protocol rules of any NFT With Music-Supported Blockchain, you may be exposed to
a risk of total loss and forfeiture of all Collectibles and other relevant digital assets.
(d) Asset Prices. The fiat-denominated prices and value in public markets of assets such as ETH, Collectibles, and 
other digital assets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. As relatively new 
products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods 
and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking 
to profit from the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value of any ETH, Collectibles, and
other digital assets may decline below the price for which you acquire such asset through the Service or on any other
platform. You acknowledge and agree that the costs and speeds of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain 
based systems are variable and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability 
to access or use any ETH or other cryptocurrency, Collectibles, or other digital assets associated with the Service.
(e) Regulatory Uncertainty. Blockchain technologies and digital assets are subject to many legal and regulatory 
uncertainties, and the Service, Collectibles, and other digital assets could be adversely impacted by one or more 
regulatory or legal inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could impede or limit 
your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of such assets and technologies.
(f) Cryptography Risks. Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances 
such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to NFT With Music-Supported Blockchain(s), 
the Service, Collectibles, and other digital assets, including the theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.
(g) Fork Handling. Certain elements of the Service, NFT With Music-Supported Blockchains, NFTs, Collectibles, 
and other digital assets may be subject to “forks.” Forks occur when some or all persons running the software 
clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that: 
(i) changes the protocol rules in backwards-compatible or backwards-incompatible manner that affects which 
transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating
to the future operation of the protocol; or
(ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and 
thus may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may 
be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original. NFT With Music may not be
able to anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of forks, and does not assume any risk, liability
or obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, NFT With Music does not 
assume any responsibility to notify you of pending, threatened or completed forks. NFT With Music will determine
its response(s) to such forks in its sole and absolute discretion, without any duty or obligation or liability to you 
for such response (or lack of such response). NFT With Music reserves the right to only allow one NFT to be
associated with the relevant metadata forming the Collectible, notwithstanding that copies of such NFT may 
exist on both chains following a fork. You assume full responsibility to independently remain apprised of and 
informed about possible forks, and to manage your own interests in connection therewith.
(h) Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies. Smart Contracts deployed to NFT With Music-Supported Blockchains are public software utilities which are accessible directly through a Wallet. Because the Service does not 
provide Wallet software or NFT With Music-Supported Blockchain nodes, such software constitutes an essential
third-party or User dependency without which the Service cannot be utilized and Collectibles and other digital assets
cannot be traded or used. Furthermore, Collectible Descriptors defining the art, text or other data associated with
a Collectible must be stored off of NFT With Music- Supported Blockchains. Collectibles created on NFT With Music
have their Collectible Descriptors stored on the IPFS system through an IPFS node associated with a distributed 
cloud service (e.g., Pinata), but NFT With Music cannot guarantee continued operation of such IPFS node, the integrity
and persistence of data on IPFS, or the distributed cloud service. Collectibles not created on NFT With Music may 
have Collectible Descriptors stored in an IPFS node associated with a third-party decentralized storage chain (e.g., 
Filecoin, Arweave), on a personal IPFS node, or through a third-party centralized cloud (e.g., AWS). NFT With Music 
cannot guarantee the continued operation of such third-party platforms.
(i) Viruses, Hacking, Phishing, Etc. The Service, NFT With Music, or your NFTs may be the target of third-party attacks, including but not limited to phishing, bruteforcing, inactive listing exploits or the use of viruses (“Third-Party
Attacks”). NFT With Music will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss
or damage sustained by You in connection with Third-Party Attacks.
13.4 Legal Limitations on Disclaimers. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties
or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and 
limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply in full to you. The disclaimers and limitations of liability 
provided in these Terms will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
13.5 Officers, Directors, Etc. All provisions of these Terms which disclaim or limit obligations or liabilities 
of NFT With Music will also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the officers, directors, members, employees, 
independent contractors, agents, stockholders, debtholders, and affiliates of NFT With Music.
13.6 THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT (INCLUDING USER CONTENT) AVAILABLE 
THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NFT WITH MUSIC
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE 
SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT (INCLUDING USER CONTENT) AVAILABLE THROUGH 
THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY
ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. NFT With Music DOES NOT WARRANT 
THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT (INCLUDING
USER CONTENT) OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR
FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND NFT With Music DOES NOT 
WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.
13.7 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE 
SERVICE OR NFT WITH MUSIC ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH 
THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF NFT With Music ENTITIES OR THE 
SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY 
DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR PURCHASE, SALE OR TRANSFER OF 
ANY COLLECTIBLE OR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU 
USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR 
MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING 
USER CONTENT.
13.8 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NFT WITH MUSIC ENTITIES BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
(INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, 
THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER
OR NOT ANY NFT With Music ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.
13.9 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 14.6 AND 14.7 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF NFT WITH MUSIC ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE
OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED 
TO THE GREATER OF:
(A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO NFT WITH MUSIC FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 
12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR
(B) US$50.
13.10 EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER
OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS 
BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF 
THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE 
AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION
13 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
13.11 THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 13 APPLY TO 
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. NFT With Music does not disclaim any warranty or other 
right that NFT With Music is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.
14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
14.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and NFT With Music in the most expedient
and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 14.2 and 14.5, you and NFT With Music 
agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. 
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge 
or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by 
courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to 
arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether 
based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of 
whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND NFT WITH MUSIC
ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
14.2 Limited Survival Period for Dispute. Any dispute you may have in connection with the Service or any 
of the other matters contemplated by these Terms will survive for the shorter of, and may be brought 
against NFT With Music solely prior to: (a) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto; 
and (b) the date that is six months after the date on which the facts and circumstances giving rise to 
such claim or cause of action first arose.
14.3 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 14.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, 
preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; 
(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is 
available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law 
to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
14.4 Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions
of this Section 14 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to
MUZI NFT LLC., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 8 The Green, Suite # 11317, Dover, 
US, DE, 19901 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account, and 
a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once NFT With Music receives your
Opt-Out Notice, this Section 14 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved
as set forth in Section 16.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your
Opt-Out Notice.
14.5 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and NFT With Music will be settled under the Federal
Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer 
Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing
forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting NFT 
With Music. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, 
applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
14.6 Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written 
notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) 
or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice 
of Arbitration”).
NFT With Music’s address for the Notice of Arbitration is: MUZI NFT LLC., 11954 Narcoossee Rd, Suite 252, 
Orlando FL 32832. 
The Notice of Arbitration must:
(a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and
(b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim 
directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received,
you or NFT With Music may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties 
will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any 
settlement offer made by you or NFT With Music must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator 
makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by NFT 
With Music in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, NFT With Music will pay to you the higher of: 
(a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and
(b) US$10,000.
14.7 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, NFT With Music will reimburse 
you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the 
payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location
to be agreed upon in the county and state of your residence or billing address, but if the claim is for 
US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted:
(a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;
(b) through a non- appearance based telephone hearing; or
(c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence or billing 
address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous
or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse NFT With Music
for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned 
written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision
and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment 
and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from
either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
14.8 No Class Actions. YOU AND NFT WITH MUSIC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST 
THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and NFT 
With Music agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may 
not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
14.9 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If NFT With Music makes any future change to this
arbitration provision, other than a change to NFT With Music’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may 
reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to NFT With Music’s address 
for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account will be immediately terminated and this arbitration 
provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
14.10 Enforceability. If Section 14.8 or the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, or 
if NFT With Music receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null 
and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.2 will govern any 
action arising out of or related to these Terms.
15. EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS.
We may send you emails concerning our products and services, as well as those of third parties. 
You may opt out of promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the promotional 
email itself.
16. MISCELLANEOUS
16.1 General Terms. These Terms and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into 
these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and NFT With Music
regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these 
Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may
assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any
provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by 
us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent

only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the 
use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be

and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
