          To the extent we collect this data, we may use it for the following purposes:
          • To ensure a smooth connection to the Services;
          • To ensure a great user experience of the Services;
          • To evaluate system security and stability; and
          • For general administrative purposes.
          To use the Services, you may be asked to register by providing registration information. In addition,

          registering and using the Services, you consent to receive follow-up questions and other communication,
          either from us or from relevant third parties.
          Generally, we use the personal information we collect from or about You to provide a smooth and 
          secure access to our website, services, and offerings, to ensure a great user experience, to evaluate
          system security and stability, and for further administrative purposes.
          More specifically, we use and process your personal data to:

          The legal basis for the data processing described in this section is your consent, and also the 
          fulfillment of our obligations and provision of Services.
          3. Create an account
          If you create an account with NFT With Music for any reason, we may use your name or your email
          address as your login name. Alternatively, we may use an anonymized login system for your login 
          activity. The creation of an account is required because the Services may not be able to work 
          without historical data. The legal basis of the processing is your consent.
          4. Use of the Services
          In accessing and using the Services, files and other content might be uploaded or created, and other
          usage related data can be created, collected, and processed.
          The Services work best when information and content is shared. Thus, if you upload information
          or content to the Services, you should expect your information or content to be shared with others.
          We may share your information, including any files or content you provide or create in the Services,
          provided that those files or content, by their nature, support sharing.
          All the information you upload to the Services are stored on an appropriate server infrastructure 
          for processing. Data is typically stored on your mobile device and synced with Google Firebase. 
          For any files we keep, we keep them for the sole purpose of giving you and your designated third 
          parties access to the files and data for as long as you need them. During that time, we may view 
          that data to, for example, troubleshoot problems, or to gather anonymized user data.
          The legal basis of the processing is your consent.
          5. Use of our own Internet cookies
          We use cookies on the website. These are small files that your browser automatically creates
          and displays on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you access the Services. 
          Cookies do not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans, or other malicious software. 
          Cookie information is stored, and may result in a connection with a specific terminal or browser 
          being used. This does not, however, mean that we are immediately aware of your identity.
          The use of cookies serves to increase the usability of the Services. For example, we use session 
          cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages, or that you have completed 
          certain tasks or reached certain goals. These are automatically deleted after leaving the Services. 
          In addition, to improve usability, we also use temporary cookies that are stored on your device for 
          a specified period of time, typically 30 days. If you access the Services again, it will automatically 
          recognize that you have already been with us and what inputs and settings you have made, so 
          you do not have to re-enter them.
          We also use cookies to statistically record the use of the Services, and to evaluate that use for
          the purpose of optimizing the Services. These cookies allow us to automatically recognize that 
          you have already been with us when you once again access the Services. These cookies are 
          automatically deleted after a defined time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, 
          you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or always provide
          a hint appearing before a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean
          that you cannot use all features of the Services.
          Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. You also can opt-out 
          of certain cookies using the following link: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. You can 
          reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features 
          of the Services may not work properly without cookies. To learn more about cookies generally, 
          visit www.allaboutcookies.org and http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN.
          Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do 
          Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a User does not want to have 
          his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal
          receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about
          the browser’s User. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
          Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we
          do not currently respond to them.
          You also can typically remove and reject Cookies or Local Storage from the Services with 
          your browser settings. Many browsers are set to accept Cookies and Local Storage until you 
          change your settings. If you remove or reject Cookies or Local Storage, it could affect how the 
          Services work for you. In all circumstances, we may perform the foregoing information collection 
          practices directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf. Also, if you 
          access the Website or the Services from a social networking service, we may share information 
          with such social networking service in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to the extent
          permitted by your agreement with such social networking service and its privacy settings.
          We may also use other technologies such as Local Storage and Pixel Tags. “Local Storage” is
          an industry standard technology that allows a website or application to store and retrieve data on 
          a person’s computer, mobile phone or other device. We may use device or HTML5 Local Storage,
          caching or other forms of Local Storage to store your preferences, help us remember certain
          information about how you interact with the Services or display content on the through the Services
          based upon what you have viewed on various other websites. We may also use “pixel tags,” 
          “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection
          with the Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data.
          A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to you and may 
          be associated with Cookies on your hard drive or Local Storage. Pixel Tags allow us to count the 
          number of users who have visited certain pages or parts of the Services, to deliver branded services
          and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. In addition, we 
          may from time to time work with third-party companies, including advertisers, that use Cookies, 
          Local Storage and other tracking technologies to collect non-identifying information about your 
          activities on the Website or the Services in order to help us better understand the use and operation
          of the Website and the Services. These third parties may collect and analyze information about 
          your online activities over time and across different websites when you access or use the Services.
          We do not exercise control over these third party websites or services. We encourage you to read 
          the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use. By accepting this 
          Privacy Policy, and by accessing or using the Website or the Services, you are consenting to 
          permit the use of Cookies, Local Storage and Pixel Tags by us and the third-party companies with 
          which we work.
          Reasons for using cookie-related technology
          Some cookies are required for the Services to operate. Other cookies enable us to track your 
          interests, to enhance your experience while using the Services, or to target advertising.
          The types of cookies used in the Services and why they are used is as follows:
          • “Strictly necessary” cookies are required to allow us to deliver the Services to you.
          • “Performance” or “Analytics” cookies help us to collect information about how Users interact with the 
          Services and help us analyze and improve the Services. Performance or analytics cookies remain on your 
          computer after you close your browser until you delete them.
          • “Advertising” cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They help to display 
          advertisements that are based on your inferred interests, prevent the same ad from appearing too 
          often and ensure that ads are properly displayed.
          By using our cookies, we want to optimize your experience while using the Services. These 
          Services are based on our aforementioned legitimate interests, which at the same time represents 
          the legal basis for the data processing described here.
          The App does not use cookies. Rather, it stores the session data in an encrypted keychain.
          6. Use of analytics and additional services
          We may use web analytics and other services for the continuous optimization of the Services.
          The tracking provides a statistically accurate record of the use of the Services and to evaluate it for
          the purpose of optimizing our offerings. From time to time,we employ a variety of data processing
          and collection services and tools to help us provide you with the best services available. For example,
          we may use Google Firebase. Note that the list may change from time to time and is provided solely
          as examples of how we collect data. The legal basis for the data processing described in this section
          is our authorized interest in the needs-based design and continuous optimization of the Services.
          The web analytics and third-party services referred to here in is transmitted to our server and stored
          there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the Services, to compile reports onuser activity
          and to provide other services for the purposes of market research and tailor-made design of Services.
          This information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if third parties process
          this data in the order.
          You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your software accordingly; however, if you 
          limit or prevent the installation of cookies, some features of the Services may not be fully exploited,
          or exploited at all. You can prevent the collection by analytics data by opting out of the collection
          of such data. In that case, an opt-out cookie will be set which will prevent the future collection of 
          your data when you access the Services. If you delete your cookies, you must reset the opt-out 
          cookie again.
          Finally, you may be asked to opt into a sharing of your location. Note that if you choose not to 
          share your location the Services may not work with full functionality.
          7. Social media plug-ins
          We may use Social Plug-ins in the Services from, for example, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
          and LinkedIn to increase awareness of the Services, and for promotional purposes. We are not 
          responsible for activity or content found on those (and any other) third-party sites. Please note 
          that a link to a third-party website or service does not mean that we have reviewed or endorsed 
          its privacy practices. If you visit a third-party website or service, you are subject to its privacy 
          practices and policies, not ours. This privacy policy does not apply to any personal information 
          that you provide to these other websites and services.
          8. Registration
          For all registrations, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure in the American Region only. 
          After registration through the Services, we will send you a notification email asking you to confirm
          that you wish to receive additional information from NFT With Music by clicking on a link in that email.
          If you no longer wish to receive information via email from us, you can unsubscribe at any time 
          without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. You 
          will find an unsubscribe link in any of our emails, and if you chose to unsubscribe, we will then 
          delete your email address from our mailing list. Note that even if you ask us to unsubscribe
          you, we may still use your email address when you request a password reset.
          10. Affected rights for users subject to GDPR
          In connection with the data processing presented here, you have the right to:
          • Request information about your personal data processed by us. In particular, you can request information

          • Demand the correction of incorrect or complete personal data stored with us;
          • Demand the correction or deletion of your personal data stored by us, unless the processing for the exercise

          a Block Chain that we do not control. If you use the Services, you are consenting to allow your 
          information to be cryptographically transmitted and stored on that blockchain, and any deletion 
          or modification of that information (to the extent possible on a blockchain) is governed by the 
          terms of the relevant Smart Contract.
          11. Withdrawal and Rights
          You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data provided that there are reasons
          for this arising from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct mail. In the

          If you would like to exercise your right to revocation or objection, please send an email to
          nftdemusica@gmail.com
          12. Registration Data in the American Region
          In accordance with GDPR, we use the so-called Double Opt-in method. We will only send you 
          e-mail if you confirm by clicking on a link in our notification e-mail that you are the owner of the 
          given e-mail address. If you confirm your e-mail address, we will save your e-mail address and 
          the time of registration until you unsubscribe. You can unsubscribe from e-mail at any time, except
          that we may still send you an email if you request a password reset. A corresponding unsubscribe 
          link can be found in every e-mail. A message to the above or in the specified contact information 
          (e.g. by e-mail or letter) is also sufficient. The legal basis of this processing is your consent in
          accordance with. Art. 6 para. 1 lit of the GDPR.
          In our email, we use commercially available technologies that measure the interactions with the 
          e-mail (e.g. opening the e-mail, clicked links). We use this data in pseudonymous form for general 
          statistical evaluations as well as for the optimization and further development of our content and 
          customer communication. This is done with the help of small graphics that are embedded in the 
          e-mail (so-called pixels). The data is collected exclusively pseudonymized and also not linked 
          with your other personal information. Legal basis for this is our aforementioned legitimate interest.
          Through our e-mail, we want toshare content relevant to our customers and better understand 
          what readers are actually interested in. If you do not want us to include your information in our
          analysis of usage behavior, you can unsubscribe from e-mails or deactivate graphics in your e-mail
          program by default. The data for the interaction with our e-mails may be stored pseudonymously 
          for 30 days and then completely anonymized.
          13. Storage time
          As a matter of principle, we store personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the contractual 
          or legal obligations to which we have collected the data. Thereafter, we delete the data immediately,
          unless we need the data until the expiration of the statutory limitation period for evidence for civil 
          claims or for statutory storage requirements.
          Even after that, we sometimes have to save your data for accounting reasons. We are obliged to 
          do so because of legal documentation obligations which may arise from legal obligations. The 
          deadlines for storing documents are two to ten years.
          14. Data security
          If you have created an account, access to this account is only possible after entering your personal
          password. You should always keep your access information confidential and close the browser 
          window when you stop communicating with us, especially if you share your computer with others.
          In addition, we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology in connection with the highest encryption
          level supported by your browser. In general, this is a 256-bit encryption. Firebase services encrypt
          data in transit using HTTPS, and also encrypted in the database. Firebase logically isolates customer
          data. In addition, we take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect
          your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or 
          against unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved 
          in line with technological developments.
          Although we take precautions intended to help protect the personal information that we collect 
          and process, no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure. Any transmission of 
          your personal information is at your own risk and we expect that you will use appropriate security 
          measures to protect your personal information.
          We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any 
          breach of security. You understand and agree that we may deliver electronic notifications about 
          breaches of security to the email address that you provided to us.
          If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the security of and the information in 
          your account, including your password.
          15. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION
          The Services we provide are intended solely for adults and for adult use. We do not knowingly 
          collect any information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or legal guardian becomes 
          aware that his or her child is using our services, or has provided us with any personally identifiable 
          information, he or she should contact us at nftdemusica@gmail.com. If we become aware that
          a child under 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will promptly 
          delete such information along with the child’s account.
          To contact us, you may use the following contact information:

          Subject to certain limitations, the FCPA provides Florida consumers the right to request to know 
          more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including 
          how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any 
          “sales” of their personal information that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against 
          for exercising these rights.
          We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email 
          address. Government identification may be required. Consumers can also designate an authorized
          agent to exercise these rights on their behalf.
          Please note:
          • We may not honor part or all of a request you make to exercise your rights under CCPA – for example, 
          certain information we collect is exempt from this California Privacy Notice, such as publicly-available 
          information collected from a government agency. When this occurs and we do not honor your request,
          we will explain why in our response.
